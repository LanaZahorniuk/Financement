### Relationships

- **roles** and **authorities** are linked through the **authority_role** table to define authority-role relationships.
- **users** and **users_info** are linked via **user_info_id** to separate authentication logic from user core information.
- **accounts**, **budget**, **expense**, **income**, and other tables are used to track financial operations and planning.

This structured database schema enables efficient management and tracking of users' financial activities, ensuring data integrity and providing comprehensive insights into budgeting, expenses, and incomes.
